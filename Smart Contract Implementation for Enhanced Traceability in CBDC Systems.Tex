% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass[letterpaper,twocolumn,10pt]{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code

\title{\textbf{Smart Contract Implementation for Enhanced Traceability in Central Bank Digital Currency Systems}} % Sets article title
\author{
    Sirawit Techavanitch \\ sirawit@live4.utcc.ac.th \\ \textit{School of Engineering} \\ University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) \and 
    Supachate Innet \\ supachate@live4.utcc.ac.th \\ \textit{School of Engineering} \\ University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) } % Sets authors name
\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled

% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
    \maketitle % creates title using information in preamble (title, author, date)
    
    % \section{Introduction} % creates a section
    \textbf{\textit{Abstract}} TODO 
    \begin{equation} % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as Anti-Money Laundering, Blockchain, Counter Financial Terrorism, Central Bank Digital Currencies, Smart Contract mat
    \end{equation}
    If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).  
    Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
     \LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.
    
    For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.\\
